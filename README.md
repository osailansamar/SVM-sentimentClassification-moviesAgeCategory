# SVM-sentimentClassification-moviesAgeCategory

Several movies have different categories and each category has its own filters depending on the content of the movie. Sentiment classification has a huge opportunity to help in automatic analysis of movies filtering. The purpose of this project is to filter movie reviews to classify the movie either as underage or above 18 movies using Support Vector Machine algorithm. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the experiment and how the method categorizes the movie reviews.
